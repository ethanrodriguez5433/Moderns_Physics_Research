My research in Modern Physics invovles using a CosmicWatch Muon detector.
By sending the detector on a weather balloon we collected flux rate of muons at varying altitudes. 
To analyze data they had to be compared with NASA GPS data and graphed.
The goal of this research was to determine a correlation between elevation and muon flux rate to see if a CosmicWatch Muon detector could be an alternative to GPS in the future
